				A warm shaft of sunlight filtered in through the open window. It was accompanied by a cool breeze. It smelled of honeysuckle. He squeezed the trigger tighter, feeling the tension on his index finger.

			“Bang, bang!” “You missed me, stupid.” “I did not, you’re dead!” The ten year old pointed his index finger at his friend. He cocked his thumb back. “You couldn’t shoot straight if your life depended on it, Chris.”
			The one named Chris laughed aloud then took off running across the spacious back yard. “Bang, bang!” His friend took off after him. The two boys chased each other through the swing set, around the plastic above ground pool, over a metal jungle jim. Still laughing, Chris scrambled up a tall old oak tree, followed closely by the other boy. Fifteen feet up, Chris spun around and shimmied backwards, onto a long, sturdy branch.

			The other boy watched his friend move further away. Chris’ right ankle came to rest inches beneath an electrical power line.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Don’t move!”
		</p>
		<p>
			Chris froze in place, “Why not?”
		</p>
		<p>
			A warm shaft of sunlight filtered through the leaves. It was accompanied by a cool breeze. It smelled of honeysuckle.

		<p>
			A crooked half smile crept across the boy’s face,
		</p>
		<p>
			“Because… there’s a snake crawling up your right leg.”

				Chris jumped.<br></br>The arc of white light blinded the ten year old momentarily. When his vision returned, he saw Chris’ face twisted in pain. The mouth was frozen open in a silent scream.

	The acrid scent of ozone filled his lungs. He thought it smelled like burnt chocolate.
